# xo_dockerize
Adds the skeleton of files needed to get your project working with Docker and ElasticBeanstalk

The goal of this project is to enable any existing or new project to conform to a template of dockerizing and deploying to Elastic Beanstalk.

It adds the necessary files to your project so that you can just run
